Lasagna,,RecipeTin Eats,www.recipetineats.com,https://www.recipetineats.com/lasagna/,2017-05-19T16:00:00+00:00,PT260M,10,"Recipe video above. One of my signature recipes! This is a lasagna made the traditional Italian way, with a slow cooked ragu and a béchamel sauce (""Besciamella""). No ricotta - that's the American-Italian version. Though it requires patience to make, it is worth every minute. The ragu bolognese is melt-in-you-mouth tender and the sauce is rich and thick. Makes 8 giant or 10 normal servings. This lasagna has 4 layers of lasagna sheets with 3 layers of meat and cheese sauce, then finished with a cheese sauce topping. You could stretch it to 4 ragu layers. If making 5 layers, scale up the recipe by 25% (click on servings and slide) and use a very deep pan!"
